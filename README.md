Warning: This is mostly a collection of my notes. I haven't tested if these steps work perfectly on a fresh install. You should be able to debug things yourself if anything goes wrong.

I encourage you to customize this as much as possible, to make it *your* perfect setup, not mine.

# Setup notes

## TV

Get yourself something you can use as a screen for your setup. Ideally, it should be as dumb as possible - simply showing the ouput of the computer you plug into it.

I couldn't find a dumb TV, so I got a smart TV, and used settings to dumb it down a bit.

I got `SAMSUNG 55" 4K UHD LED TV TU55CU7105KXXC` (3840x2160). I connect it with HDMI, and used the following settings:

- All Settings
- General & Privacy
- Start Screen Options
- Autorun Last App

My HDMI connection is an "App" apparently.

Side note: Some TVs have hidden menus which can allow you to dumb them down even more, [example](https://youtu.be/LGngUs30dh0). The regular settings seemed to work fine for me though.

## Computer

You need a computer to power your setup. An old used laptop is perfect.

I used a 5 year old Lenovo laptop with a broken keyboard (becaue I spilt earlgrey tea into it).

## Remote

Since this setup is a regular desktop setup disgused as a smart TV, you need something to be your mouse. You need a keyboard too (although maybe you trigger an on-screen keyboard).

I chose `WECHIP W3 2.4G 3-i-1 2.4G Air Mouse`. It uses a small gyroscope as input for the mouse, and has a small keyboard on the back. It's good but a bit flimsy.


## Optional extras

### HDMI USB CEC adaptor

I use [CEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control) to allow my computer to suspend my TV. I need an adaptor, because the laptop doesn't support the CEC protocol itself.

I use the `Pulse Eight USB-CEC Adapter`.

### USB extender

For your mouse, you'll likely get a very small USB receiver, [example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Logitech_unifying_receiver.jpg). Depending where you place your laptop, you might need to extend the receiver.

I use a generic USB extender, [example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USB_extender_cable.jpg).

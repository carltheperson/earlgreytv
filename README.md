Set tv as primary in Gnome UI then do:
sudo cp ~/.config/monitors.xml  /var/lib/gdm3/.config/


# Notes

Nice goals:
 - Never having to bust out the keyboard. Everybody knows that the big screen is the main one.
 - Being able to remove the backplate

[x] A way for gnome login thing to think the big screen is the main one
[ ] A way to share configs
[ ] A way for the TV to suspend fast when the computer does
[ ] A way to shut the screen off in sway (solves tiny cursor issue)
